This README describes the structure for the Blueprint CSS SVN repository.

Non-Blueprint Developers:  
------------------------
Grab your code from any of the /<directory>/TAGS/<tag_name> directories. This code is safe for use. 
Code from all other directories should be considered "in development" and therefore potentially unstable/non-working.
