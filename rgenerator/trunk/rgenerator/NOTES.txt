NOTES.txt

Added this file as a quick note pad to keep notes for us to ponder during development.

= rgenerator & BlueprintCSS.com ?

I was just thinking that rgenerator could become the actual BP site solution, ie, doing it all, 
not just the generator bit:
-- the home page could hold news about it all
-- /generator/ gives you the generator in it's finished glory
-- /docs/ gives you a wiki type of solution
-- /source/ gives you access to the SVN via a Warehouse (http://warehouseapp.com/)
-- /blog/  ??

More processing should take place on the client side via some JS stuff, so I've added the new LiveValidation
[ http://www.livevalidation.com/ ] to the repository, and will be making use of that for validation client side.
Just have to work out some JS loading issues and then begin writing the implementation for it.

Also, PLEASE, PLEASE do NOT start removing design elements! Create alternative files with your design ideas
if you need to, so that we can switch between versions quickly and easily.

Example:  
  Instead of editing _step_grid.rhtml, just create a temporary _step_grid2.rhtml with your design in it.
