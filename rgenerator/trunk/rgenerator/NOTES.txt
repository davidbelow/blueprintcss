NOTES.txt
=====================

Added this file as a quick note pad to keep notes for us to ponder during development.

= rgenerator & BlueprintCSS.com ?

I was just thinking that rgenerator could become the actual BP site solution, ie, doing it all, 
not just the generator bit:
-- the home page could hold news about it all
-- /generator/ gives you the generator in it's finished glory
-- /docs/ gives you a wiki type of solution
-- /source/ gives you access to the SVN via a Warehouse (http://warehouseapp.com/)
-- /blog/  ??

  <li><%= link_to_remote "REMOVE", :url => {:action => 'set_grid_remove'} %></li>
  <li><%= link_to_remote "DEFAULT", :url => {:action => 'set_grid_default'} -%></li>
