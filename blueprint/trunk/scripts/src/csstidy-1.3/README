CSSTidy is an opensource CSS parser and optimiser. It is available as
executable file (available for Windows, Linux and OSX) which can be
controlled per command line and as PHP script (both with almost the same
functionality).

In opposite to most other CSS parsers, no regular expressions are used and
thus CSSTidy has full CSS2 support and a higher reliability.


See the file INSTALL for building and installation instructions.

CSSTidy is free software.  See the file COPYING for copying conditions.
