  * Extracted the support for CSS buttons into a new plugin. [OFB]
  * Added new plugin structure. [OFB]

  * Re-added the hack for clearing floats without extra markup. [OFB]
  * Added Changelog.txt to track changes in each release. [GR]
  * Cleaned up and rationalized SVN dir structure. [GR, OFB]
  * print.css : removed reference to 'baseline.png' as it no longer exists. [GR]
  * grid.css : removed reference to '.first' css class as it no longer exists. [GR]
  * Added append-13 to append-23 and prepend-13 to prepend-23 to allow pushing elements
    to both extreme sides of the grid. Added test cases to tests/grid.css [GR]
  * Moved test sample files to blueprint/tests sub-directory so tests stay with the code. [GR]
  * Consolidated all references to release version number to screen.css [OFB]
  * Added ruby script (generate_compressed_css.rb) to scripts dir, and 'csstidy' binary (OS X Universal) 
    for generating tidied version of Blueprint (lib/compressed.css).
  * Consolidated test pages into one single page (test.html).  Uses compressed stylesheet by default.  This ensures test of 
    the chain of generation.  (todo) Intention is to delete other test files if single file works well. (todo) ensure singular 
    test file contains latest changes to other test files.   [GR]
  * Moved the blueprint framework to its own folder in the package, so that the tests, script,
    license and readme don't clutter up our BP folder. [OFB]
  * Re-saved grid.png with Photoshop to remove Fireworks data which was bloating it.  
    Now its about 3KB instead of 40+KB. Resolves Issue 22. [GR]
  * Moved compressed files to new compressed dir [OFB]
  * print.css is now also being generated by the compressor ruby script and is available for use.
  * Added new script 'validate_css.rb' which will validate all css files and present a report with 
    a local java binary of the W3C validator.
  * Created an experimental CSS classes plugin, by popular demand. [OFB]
