#summary Changes between versions of BP

The next version of BP is also listed here, since we write down the changes as we make them. Take it as a preview, and with a grain of salt. :)

===BP 0.4===

  * All font sizes and line-heights are now relative. That means that you only have to set your preferred font size at a single place, and everything adapts perfectly.
  * New IE stylesheet, loaded with conditional comments, for IE fixes.
  * FIX: <hr> now works correctly in IE6
  * FIX: IE6 3px bug mostly fixed 
  * `.amp` is now `.alt`, since it works great on other text (prepositions, to name one) as well.
  * Added class `.push-0`to right-align an object.

===BP 0.3===

  * First to use a changelog. ;)
