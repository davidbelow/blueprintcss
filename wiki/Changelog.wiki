#summary Changes between versions of BP

The next version of BP is also listed here, since we write down the changes as we make them. Take it as a preview, and with a grain of salt. :)

===BP 0.4===

  * All font sizes and vertical margins are now elastic, through the use of em units. Resizing works great in every tested browser.
  * Comes with a new, compressed version of BP, which reduces the size of the core files by 60 percent.
  * Support for incremental leading, contributed by Mark Boulton.
  * Adds perfected CSS buttons, by Kevin Hale of Particletree fame.
  * `.amp` is now `.alt`, since it works great on other text (prepositions, to name one) as well.
  * Added class `.push-0` to right-align an object.
  * Fixes all known IE bugs.
  * Loads of minor fixes and additions.

===BP 0.3===

  * First to use a changelog. ;)
